## ASCIIeNGINE

...is a tool which allows you to make advance graphics in the terminal (at least thats what I hope when it's done).

### HOW TO USE:

You may use ASCIIeNGINE in two ways:

1. Directly implement all the files into your project and put them into your Makefile
2. Compile into a library and use it that way
